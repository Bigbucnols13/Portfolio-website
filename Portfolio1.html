        <h1>Project 1: Plan a PC</h1>
        <p> <b>When I did the Plan a PC Project I found the parts for my dream PC. This helped me 
            learn about new parts and about the parts which helped me learn a whole ton about PC's.</p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>Reflecting on the Plan a PC project, I learned a lot about different computer parts and more and it was kind of interesting. 
            I felt like I did really well finishing the project and doing everything I was told to do. 
            Overall i thought I had a pretty good project.</p>
