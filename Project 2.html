        <h1>Project 2: Website Portfolio</h1>
        <p> <b>When I did the Website Portfolio I did stuff like getting a folder favicon for my project. 
            I learned a lot about webstites and thought I did a good job.  .</p>

        <p>Reflecting on this project, I learned all about creating websites and coding. Before, I barely knew anything 
            about coding and stuff but now I kind of have the hang of it. I am pretty happy how I did witb this project and 
            am more comfortable too.</p>
